            <p class="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
                Hello! I'm Mayur Chandrakant Jadhav, a passionate IT professional with a focus on cybersecurity, cloud computing, and web design. With hands-on experience in various domains, including offensive security and cloud-based solutions, I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects that drive innovation in the tech world.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
                I’m currently a Red Team Analyst at Deepcytes Cyber Labs, where I specialize in identifying and mitigating security threats. My work extends beyond security as I've played a pivotal role in various projects, including the development of an offensive web security framework and a cloud-based system alerting tool. These experiences have honed my skills in Python, AWS, and Java, as well as in UI/UX design, where I’ve created intuitive interfaces using tools like Figma.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
                In addition to my professional pursuits, I’m in my final year of Computer Engineering at Pillai College of Engineering (Mumbai University). My academic and extracurricular involvement includes leading a 60+ member team as Chairperson of the CSI chapter, where I've organized and spoken at numerous technical events, impacting over 100 participants. I'm also an active participant in hackathons, where I continuously test and expand my skills.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-8">
